# Coinbase Pro Algo-Trading Tutorials

I created this repository to test code for algorithmic trading with Coinbase Pro using Python. I'm making a series of videos as I go along, so I needed a place to put the code that I show in the video, in case someone wants to check it out and try it for themselves. 

The YouTube playlist for this project is here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9DUI78QMgX7bP22kZw_eJ-v1lD9XIeYc

Let me know what you think in the video comments. I chose to use Coinbase Pro because I am more familiar with Coinbase as a company. You can star this repository to see check the code that I put out. Just keep in mind that they will be mostly in tutorial style and complementary to the videos on YouTube. You can also follow me on YouTube for those videos.

## Coinbase Pro Algo Trading Part 1

This Jupyter notebook introduces the "cbpro" Python package that allows us to interact with the Coinbase Pro API. There is no actual "algorithmic" trading here. I show how to manually perform some tasks such as placing a market order, through the API. The idea is to build up from there in the following videos.
